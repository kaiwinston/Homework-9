<p>For my Homework 9 assignment, I decided to make a google form asking four purely informational questions regarding housing statistics in New York City. My data set was small, 22 people and not a very diverse bunch either as they were all my own friends or aquaintences which comes with its own bias. All in all, the results were pretty scattered and in no way represented New York City as a whole. I then displayed this data Via color coded horizontal bar graphs under the backdrop of the city skyline for visual appeal.
